<div>  <p>There are a few reasons I have opted to take a big step to learn coding. We live in an ever-changing world of technology. We now have robots that vacuum the floors, cars that run on electricity and devices that can control our homes from the palm of your hand. With these changes of technology, I knew it was time to take action to keep up with it. I have been in customer service for a long time now, so I felt I was ready to learn a new skill. This new skill is meant to better myself and to better my family. I have always had an interest in in how things work, and I wanted to take that and combine it with the changing of the times. </p>
